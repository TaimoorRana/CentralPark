###Coding Conventions:

1. **ClassName** - Upper case for First letter
  * Example: class MyClass{};
2. **variableName** - Lower Case for First letter
  * Example: int myTimer;

3. //    - for single line comment
4. /* */ - for multi line comment

5. Add comments on top of code that might not be obvious to others


6. **Please avoid magic numbers**
 
7. Add comments on top of **all methods**. All made by US. There's no need for documenting OpenGL, GLEW, GLFW functions (Example : callback functions). 
8. Describe what the method does, Explain the paramenter
 * Example:
     ```
     /**
     * This method take the mouse Y position of the mouse and mulitiplies by the amount specified
     * yPos : mouse Y position
     * amount : number to multiply by
     * return : the y positon of the next cube
     **/
     int example (int yPos, double amount)
     
     ```
